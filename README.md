UltraEdit Wordfiles, used for syntax highlighting inside of UltraEdit

"UltraEdit is a commercial text editor for Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X created in 1994 by the founder of IDM Computer Solutions Inc., Ian D. Mead." - Wikipedia

I found a need for syntax highlighting for RISC-V assembly while working in RISC-V for school, I was instructed to use ms visual code but I personally do not enjoy working in msvs so and I have been exposed to UltraEdit (which I soon fell in love with) so I ventured out and decided to try and find a syntax highlighting file for either Notepad++ or UltraEdit. After an hour or two (probably more) I can to the conclusion that I was not going to find a solution for my RISC-V needs. So I endeavored upon learning how to create my own. I assume in my travels I may need to make more so I will be adding those as they become a need and I create them.
